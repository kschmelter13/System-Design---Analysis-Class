# System-Design-Analysis-Class

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
- The driverpass project was a way of practicing real word system design and analysis for a mock company. Drivepass was a company that wanted to create a system for users to be able to practice online or in person for the drivers license test. They wanted to create an LMS that managed and handles user functionality.

What did you do particularly well?
- I think that I understood the concept of what a modularized LMS needed in order for it to handle the users and mainly the companies reqests for their users and I was able to convey that clearly thorught easy to understand documentation and diagrams.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- If i were to revise one part of my work i would go over the system use cases and try to make a more structure layout so that no processes are confused with another.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- I was able to underwstand the companies business requirements and shift those into technical requrements, and then document them in how they would be implemented in a real system by created multiple different diagrams for different system components. Its so important to be abel to meet the business requrements because at the end of they it is a business that need functionality.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
- I approach designing software by looking at the business requirements and overall goals of servicing the user, and then try to interperet what kind if data they will need to access, modify, and be able to use. Based on those requirements I would look for existing tools that work to create a foundation for the functionality and use case of the system.
